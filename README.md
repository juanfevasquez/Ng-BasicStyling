# NgBasicStyling

> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

Welcome!  This is a repo derived from another repo called [CSS Architecture Patterns for Ng](https://github.com/juanfevasquez/CssArchitecturePatternsForNg) where I explain the different ways you can use css for an Angular app and how each might affect performance.  It also explains some key concepts of CSS Architecture like specificity, naming conventions, pre-processors, repaints and reflows.  It is quite dense and that's why I decided to created this smaller repo where I only explain the different ways that Angular provides for us to load css styles in our apps.  I hope you enjoy it.

## Install the repo

```
npm install
